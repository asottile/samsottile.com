    <h2 class="my-4">the leah books</h2>
    <p>
      Leah’s story is quite beautiful, the ultimate paradox of a special needs
      person and her family. Leah is a spectacular individual just as she is,
      but I cannot help imagining what she might have been and how much the
      world is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All proceeds from the Leah Books will go to her special needs trust fund.
