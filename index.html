      Leah’s story is quite beautiful, the ultimate paradox of a special needs
      person and her family. Leah is a spectacular individual just as she is,
      but I cannot help imagining what she might have been and how much the
      world is missing.
    </p>
    <p>
      All proceeds from the Leah Books will go to her special needs trust fund.

    <h2 class="my-4 ss-h2">about the author</h2>
    <div class="row align-items-center">
      <div class="col-12 col-sm-7 col-lg-8">
        <p>
          Much of my life and energy is focused on caring for my daughter
          Leah, a young adult who is non-verbal with severe or “classic”
          autism.  She has unique needs, and these stories are about the
          discovery of those needs and the adaptations of my behavior to
          better care for her.
          <br><br>

          Through understanding that Leah (like every other person) is a
          Masterpiece, defined by her individual characteristics, rather than
          possessing the characteristics of a label, we can learn her
          language, her motivations, and love her deeply for exactly who she
          is.
          <br><br>

          My history has equipped me to handle whatever comes our way.
          Certainly, ever since a turning point admonishment/encouragement
          from my late father at the age of 16 and probably even before that,
          I have been an “active actor” in life as opposed to a “passive
          participant”.
          <br><br>

          These are the common themes in all of the books of this series:  the
          choices that we make to live one way or the other, the ability to
          shape the world around us, the power that each individual has to
          define themselves and create meaning, the importance of every
          moment, and the unbreakable connection between all things past,
          present, and future.
